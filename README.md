    What was your motivation?

        The motivation for this project is to meet CSC 190 and CSC 191 requirement. The project was inspired by our client wanting to do a complete overhaul of their preexisting website for this business. Thus the name project overhaul. The main motivation for project overhaul is to discover new technolgies, implementing a design sought out by our client, and to work for an end goal where both the developers & client are happy with the end product. 

    Why did you build this project?

        This project was developed as a need for our client wanting a redesign of their preexisting website. Our client has recently acquired this business from a previous owner. With new management and developers ready to learn new technologies, it was an ideal opportunity for both parties. 

    What problem does it solve?

        Our project resolves three issues. 
        
        The first issue both parties wanted to tackle is the overall design and look of the website. The previous website is barely functional and is not well suited for their customers to interact with. Our solution is to redesign the user interface to bring a modern look and feel for their customers to appreciate. 

        The second was addressing the need for a reservation system for our client's business. Our client was looking for a management feature where they can have their customers create reservations within our webapp. This feature utilizes the React Modal Library as well with Javascript form functionality. 

        The last issue is the menu. Our client wanted to showcase what Asian N Cajun 2 has to offer to their customers. The best way is to display their menu items through the Menu section of the webapp. The webapp pulls information from our Firebase Database to get the item prices and information with their respective menu photos.

### Environment Setup/Requirements:
    NodeJS
    Visual Studio Code
    Google Firebase (backend)
    
### Download Instructions:

    Since our project is a website, you can see it running live by visiting the webpage [insert webpage link here].

    Alternatively, you can run it locally on your machine. To do so, you must install NodeJS and download the source files from this repository.
    
    While in the "frontend" folder, run 'npm install' in the terminal to install all dependenices (if it gives you errors, you may have to restart your machine and try running the command again).

    Once that is done, run 'npm start' and the webpage will load in your web browser on localhost.
    
    We use Google Firebase as our backend and database. It stores all of our menu items, images for the menu items, and reservations and is managed in our Google account.
